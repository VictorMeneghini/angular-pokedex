This project was created to practice some of the main concepts of the angular framework.

In addition, I also used it to practice a little scss, BEM (css architecture), docker, ci/cd and tests (:


Take a look at the project in production: https://www.poke-dex.victormeneghini.com/



### Running locally

to run the project locally there are two options.

1. Docker: You can build the docker image and then run the container (:
2. Angular CLI: Runs `ng s` and check it in `http://localhost:4200/`
